title: "Clearing cache and reacting to state disposal (WIP)"
---

Things to talk about:

- @Riverpod(keepAlive)
- What "no-longer used" means (consumer tracking listeners)
- ref.keepAlive (and how it's different from @Riverpod(keepAlive))
- ref.onDispose
- ref.onCancel
- ref.onResume
- ref.invalidate/refresh
- how providers with arguments should use autoDispose to avoid leaks

- showcase how to combine keepAlive+onCancel/onResume to implement features such as "keep providers alive for 5 minutes after last usage"
